# Statement Concerning WEEE

The Directive 2002/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27
January 2003 on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) came into force
on February 13, 2005, and has been transposed into national law by the European
Union (EU) member states. The EU Directive 2002/96/EC was created to improve the
collection and recycling of WEEE throughout the EU, and to reduce the level of non-
recycled waste. Directive 2002/96/EC was repealed with effect from 15 February
2014 and replaced by EU Directive 2012/19/EC of the European Parliament and of
the Council of 4 July 2012 on waste electrical and electronic equipment (“WEEE
recast” or WEEE 2”).

This document provides a general description of xxxxx’s approach to meeting the
requirements of the WEEE legislation including EU Directive 94/62/EC on packaging
and packaging waste and its amendments 2004/12/EC and 2018/852/EC. The
directives gave some flexibility to the member states in implementing their individual
WEEE regulations leading to the definition of varying implementation requirements
by country and may involve considerations beyond those reflected in this document.
This statement is not intended and shall not be interpreted or construed to be legal
advice or to be legally binding on xxxxx or any third party.

# Commitment
xxxxx is committed to a safe and healthy environment and has been working
diligently to ensure its compliance with WEEE legislation. xxxxx and all products
sold by xxxxx will comply with WEEE legislation by:
• Designing its equipment and packaging with consideration to future dismantling,
recovery and recycling requirements;
• Marking its products with the required symbols and informing users of their
obligation to separate WEEE from general waste and dispose of it through the
provided recycling systems;
• Reporting information as required by each member state;
• Facilitating the collection, recycling and disposal of WEEE as defined by the
directive and applicable member state regulation;
• Providing information to treatment centers according to the requirements defined
in the local regulation.
xxxxx continues to work with WEEE consortia (VERE Mandate Reference:
103938-001) and suppliers and our distributors and resellers to provide efficient
processes for complying with WEEE obligations and we continue to refine those
processes. xxxxx will be closely watching the EU WEEE recast process and its
transposition into national law to implement upcoming requirements to the date they
become effective.
